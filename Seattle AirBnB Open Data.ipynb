    "#### We see that March, and December to be the months with hightest number of houses available for over 10 days. If we relate the last two graphs, it looks like all the ~2800 houses that were available in Dec were available for more than 10 days and a lot of those  were available even the entire month.\n",
    "#### This would have driven people to drop house prices significantly in the following month which would have resulted in lesser houses being available for over 10 days in Jan. If you compare this with what we saw in the previous graph, we can conclude that although the overall number of house availabile (~3600) was highest in Jan, ~1000 houses (~30% of total available houses in Jan) were occupied for more than 20 days. This also explains why we see minimum average monthly price in Jan which could have been a promotional offer or discounted price by the hosts to drive more people. A similar pattern is also seen in July and August. The high demand of houses in July and August explains their high prices which starts to decline after August and Sepetember since the houses are less in demand starting mid-September.\n",

       "13      Queen Anne hill became a popular spot for the city's early economic and cultural elite to build their mansions, and the name derives from the architectural style typical of many of the early homes. Queen Anne is home to 29 official Seattle landmarks, including 12 historic houses. A group of residences on 14th Avenue West, built between 1890 and 1910, include one of the few remaining Queen Anne style houses on the hill. The North Queen Anne Drive Bridge, built in 1936 across Wolf Creek, is a parabolic steel arch bridge, declared a historic landmark for its unique engineering style. One of the oldest wooden-hulled tugboats still afloat, the Arthur Foss, is moored near the base of Queen Anne. Queen Anne Boulevard, which circles the crown of the hill, and some of the original retaining walls complete with decorative brickwork, balustrades, and street lights, are also designated landmarks.                                                                                                       \n",
       "14      Queen Anne is THE BEST and most desirable neighborhood in Seattle!  No where else can you be downtown in 5 minutes, yet still feel safe and removed from the hustle and bustle. The house is located on the crown of the hill, so everything is pretty much flat and walkable here compared to most of hilly Seattle. And there is a lot to walk to -- award winning bakeries and restaurants, quaint boutique style shops, and ample necessities like grocery stores and dry cleaners. Queen Anne boasts many neighborhood festivals, and a weekly Thursday night Farmers Market in the summer that a good portion of the neighborhood turns out for to buy fresh produce and have dinner together. It also has stately picturesque homes, tree lined streets, gorgeous views of the Space Needle, downtown, and the Puget Sound, as well as, many parks and activities for children, and again, super easy access to downtown!                                                                                                        \n",
       "16      Lower Queen Anne is amazing - you can walk to everything! This apartment is located in a quiet residential area, about 5-6 blocks from the neighborhood's main commercial area. Seattle Center (the plaza containing the Space Needle, EMP, Pacific Science Center, Key Arena, etc.) is about a 15 minute walk. Belltown is also an easy walk, just on the other side of Seattle Center - I walk to work in Belltown and it usually takes me about 25 minutes. Ballard and downtown are both a 10 minute trip on the Rapid Ride bus - there is a stop 3 blocks away. It's super quick and easy to get to Pike Place, the convention center, and the stadiums from here, and there are quite a few inexpensive transportation options to choose from.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "44      Queen Anne is Seattle's prime neighborhood, sitting atop a hill above the Space Needle. It's the closest neighborhood to downtown, but far enough removed to escape the noise and traffic. Queen Anne has amazing views of the Olympics, Elliot Bay and Puget Sound to the west, and of the Cascades and Lake Union to the east. There are about 10 fabulous coffee shops within 2 blocks of the house, the wonderful Café Diablo - next to our neighborhood book store - is directly across the street, and the famous 5-Spot for breakfast shouldn't be missed - just two blocks away.  Located just one block from Queen Anne Ave, many restaurants and bars and exercise studios are under a 5-min walk. Walk over the pedestrian bridge to downtown, or walk one block to catch a bus to downtown Seattle, with direct access to Pike Place Market, Safeco Field, Century Link stadium, and the Seattle Waterfront and ferry dock. Catch a glorious view of the space needle and Mt. Rainer at Kerry Park, only a ten minute walk a\n",

Queen Anne's Farmer's Market on Thursdays is a must visit during June - October.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "56      Queen Anne itself is a quiet neighborhood with  great restaurants, cafes, bakeries and bars. We're close to Seattle Center and other tourist attractions, and more exciting nightlife can be found a stroll, or quick drive, away in Fremont, Belltown and Ballard. We have some beautiful parks close by nearby including Kerry Park with a lovely view, Myrtle Edwards along the water, and Discovery Park in Magnolia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "57      6 blocks walk to Queen Anne Ave for all the shops, fine dining and nightlife.  ½ mile walk to Kerry Park for the best view of Seattle in town.  1 ½ miles to lower Queen Anne and Seattle Center.  Less than 3 miles to downtown and Pike Place Market. We are minutes from some of Seattle's best dining. My personal favorite restaurants within a five minute walk are: How to Cook a Wolf and Lloyd Martin. Groceries: Ken's Market is on the corner but Safeway and Trader Joes are within a few blocks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "201     Our townhouse is located just 5-10 minutes drive (0r a 35 minute walk) north of downtown Seattle on the west side of Lake Union. It's a short 10 minute walk into funky Fremont, with a picturesque stroll across the bridge to see the boats and sea planes on Lake Union. Grab coffee, sit at a diner, eat dinner, or visit the local pubs to experience Fremont's local flavor. Visit the resident Fremont Troll under the bridge and grab a delicious hot sandwich and gelato at Royal Grinders! The Space Needle, Pike Place Market, and all things downtown Seattle are a short car ride away (Less than 3 miles). Or walk 2 minutes to our bus stop and take a one bus direct ride right into the thick of it! So easy. We are also a 8-minute drive to the gorgeous Discovery Park with a lighthouse and numerous wooded walking trails.                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

Depending on the time you are coming home, you may or may not have to circle a block or two looking for a spot as others are also using the street for parking.

It is an easy walk to 20+ great little cafe's and restaurants. There is the little cuban coffee shop that is a delight to every sense on your body. I love our neighborhood fabric shop ... you won't believe the vintage bows and ribbons. It is a nice walk down the hill to the Seattle center, where many of the festivals take place, as are the Opera house and two theaters, the Arena, Chihuly Glass and Garden, Science Center and of course  the SPACE NEEDLE.

       "216     A community within walking distance of Downtown, Queen Anne is situated just north of Seattle Center and south of Fremont across the Lake Washington Ship Canal.   As a neighborhood, Queen Anne can refer either to the entire hill or to the central residential and business district at the top of the hill. Lower Queen Anne, refers to the area at the southern base of the hill, just north and west of Seattle Center.   The district's name derives from the architectural style, typical of so many of the early houses in this area. The historic mansions are home to many of Seattle's economic and cultural elite. In 1962, Lower Queen Anne became the site of the Century 21 Exposition, a World's Fair. The fairgrounds are now the campus of Seattle Center, home to the Space Needle, Pacific Science Center, EMP Museum, the north terminal of the Seattle Center monorail, and KeyArena, where the Seattle Storm plays. Newest to the Seattle Center campus is Chihuly Glass and Garden. Opened in Spring 2012 at t\n",

       "234     From our house, it's an easy 12-15 min walk down the hill, using the short-cut stairs (not the main roads). Those stairs are allover the QA hill. They are marked with a street signs with a picture of pedestrian on them.  We use them to walk down to Lake Union (15min),  Seattle Center/Key Arena and Monorail (12-15min).  30-35 min walk will take you to Seattle Downtown (let's say, to Macy's). Probably, 35-40 min walk to famous Pike's Market.  25 mins down the hill to Sculpture Park waterfront (using a new viaduct on 3rd street).  We are on a corner of Bigelow Ave N and Garfield Street.

       "241     It's located on the west side of Lake Union on NE side of Queen Anne just up hill from Fremont a very cool eclectic neighborhood with lots of shops and restaurants within a 10 min walk.  Canlis, a Michelin star rated restaurant, is one block away and worth booking ahead although attire is dressy (not typical Seattle casual) The piano lounge is walk in only and worth stopping by (website hidden). The view is just spectacular from Le Penthouse and every room has its  view of the lake. While there is a small market 2 blocks away most coffee houses restaurants and shopping are a half mile away in Fremont. the Fremont Sunday market is worthwhile especially in the morning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

If you're a walker, you'll love the 4-mile \"Crown of Queen Anne\" loop, which takes in all of these views!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

Queen Anne is bordered by Belltown to the south, Lake Union to the east, the Lake Washington Ship Canal to the north and Interbay to the west.  The hill became a popular spot for the city's early economic and cultural elite to build their mansions, and the name derives from the architectural style typical of many of the early homes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

We are semi-retired, having originally worked in the travel industry. Your co-host Max is fully retired.   •WE LOVE QUEEN ANNE.  We live on the north-side of Upper Queen Hill (one of the seven hills surrounding downtown) - two blocks from Seattle Pacific University (SPU), facing Fremont and the Ship Canal.   •WHY QUEEN ANNE? - When you could choose from so many other neighborhoods including staying right in the middle of downtown.    THREE MAJOR POINTS TO CONSIDER  ONE - Queen Anne is one of the closest neighborhoods to downtown as well as to the Space Needle and Seattle Center, a major cultural center and sightseeing area.  TWO - Queen Anne has some of the most incredible view points in the city due to being located on a hill.  THREE - although you are in a major city, it does not have a hectic, busy city feeling.   \n",

It's a quiet upscale neighborhood in the middle of Seattle, with lots of natural Pacific NW beauty, safe streets and plenty of parking. Want to explore other Seattle neighborhoods? See my Guidebook!  Magnolia directly borders Queen Anne & Ballard. Fremont is adjacent, Seattle Center, Belltown and downtown are 3-4 miles away. The Metro bus stops a block from the house.   An \n",

Belltown is the most densely populated neighborhood in Seattle, Washington, United States, located on the city's downtown waterfront on land that was artificially flattened as part of a regrading project. Formerly a low-rent, semi-industrial arts district, in recent decades it has transformed into a neighborhood of trendy restaurants, boutiques, nightclubs, and residential towers as well as warehouses and art galleries. The area is named after William Nathaniel Bell, on whose land claim the neighborhood was built.

Stroll just a few blocks to the nearest grocery store and the up-and-coming South Lake Union neighborhood. Head a few blocks in the other direction and you are in Seattle's core downtown shopping district with Pacific Place and Westlake Center as well as the famous Nordstrom flagship store. The Washington State Trade and Convention Center is an easy walk away, as well as Seattle Center, where you will find the iconic Space Needle; and the famous Pike Place Market is just half a mile - or 10 minutes' walk - from your front door.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "1280    About Belltown. so many words that come to mind, and a few I've heard are: amazing, eclectic, energized, caffeinated, foodie heaven, multicultural, and beautiful..... Belltown is the most densely populated neighborhood in Seattle, Washington, United States, located on the city's downtown waterfront on land that was artificially flattened as part of a regrading project. Formerly a low-rent, semi-industrial arts district, in recent decades it has transformed into a neighborhood of trendy restaurants, boutiques, nightclubs, and residential towers as well as warehouses and art galleries. The area is named after William Nathaniel Bell, on whose land claim the neighborhood was built. In 2007, CNNMoney named Belltown the best place to retire in the Seattle metro area, calling it \"a walkable neighborhood with everything you need.\" 97/100 Walk Score These are things that you should probably do if you want to experience Seattle, and dont have that much time...and the $ it to do them: - Pike Plac\n",
       "1281    The location of the Centennial Tower can't be beat, just 4 blocks to the Seattle Center for the Space Needle, EMP, Pacfic Science Center and the Monorail.  It's also a flat 15 minute walk to Pike Place Market.  Surrounded by some of Seattle's best restaurants, shopping and night life you'll find accessing it all a breeze without a car.  However, if you have a car in tow parking is available!

       "1309    Be aware that this is a urban environment. In any urban core, you can expect to hear street noise, often late into the evening. This particular condo is located 7-10 feet off the street, so if a silent outdoor environment is important to you, downtown Seattle (or any big city for that matter) may not be the best place for you to stay.

       "1383    Seattle's Belltown neighborhood is the pinnacle of downtown living.  The neighborhood is packed with famous bars, restaurants, clubs, pool halls, and music venues.  My calendar is up to date.  If your dates are available for request, the unit is vacant.  Feel free to instant book or ask me questions first. Belltown is named after William Nathaniel Bell who was a member of the Denny Party which first settled Seattle. Bell not only named the neighborhood, which abuts downtown to the northwest, but also named two of the area's major thoroughfares after two of his children (Virginia Street and Olive Way).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "1398    About Belltown. so many words that come to mind, and a few I've heard are: amazing, eclectic, energized, caffeinated, foodie heaven, multicultural, and beautiful.....  Belltown is the most densely populated neighborhood in Seattle, Washington, United States, located on the city's downtown waterfront on land that was artificially flattened as part of a regrading project. Formerly a low-rent, semi-industrial arts district, in recent decades it has transformed into a neighborhood of trendy restaurants, boutiques, nightclubs, and residential towers as well as warehouses and art galleries. The area is named after William Nathaniel Bell, on whose land claim the neighborhood was built. In 2007, CNNMoney named Belltown the best place to retire in the Seattle metro area, calling it \"a walkable neighborhood with everything you need.\" 97/100 Walk Score These are things that you should probably do if you want to experience Seattle, and dont have that much time...and the $ it to do them: - Pike Pla\n",

The city's international roots; its paradoxical struggle with growing homelessness and overdevelopment, and its 'old-town' character are all openly on display.

Just 5-10 min walk and you are in Capitol Hill where you will find shops, restaurant, bars, bowling alley (The Garage) and so many more awesome things to do. 5 minutes down the hill and you will find more -shopping -Pike Place Market -waterfront -many restaurants -Space needle -EMP Museum -Chihuly Garden -Convention Center -ferry to Bainbridge Island -water taxi to Alki! These are just some ideas.. the list goes on and on. No car needed and most places are a very short UBER ride if you don't want to walk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

Individuality and fashion statements are encouraged, and there always seems to be some sort of block party or community forum to encourage residents and visitors to mix and mingle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "1663    The First Hill / Capitol Hill area is renown for its vibrant culture, bars, museums, and underground spaces. My apartment is near two excellent art/cocktail bars and the Frye art museum (Free). The nearby luxury Sorrento hotel features stately dining and a classic brass-ring bar and fireplace. There are multiple late-night convenience stores in a 5 minute walking radius, as well as hospitals for any medical needs. You are a 5 minute walk to Pike Street and 10 minute walk to the heart of Capitol Hill (Pike and Broadway: Neumos, The Comet, Cha Cha, etc.) The area is well-lit and relatively quiet, despite being so close to downtown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

Bars & Nightclubs - You are a five minute walk to the corner of Pike & Broadway, one of the best areas for late night clubs, bars and general debauchery. Libations galore, this area probably has the highest density of bars in Seattle.  Restaurants - Lots of options here. For Mexican, hit up La Cocina Oaxaquena (you can watch them make fresh corn tortillas and make sure to get the Chicken Mole and the Pozole, DELISH!). For Indian, do Moti Mahal (Get the Saag Paneer and Butter Chicken. Limited choices otherwise). For creative american fusion, check out Union. For super pricey joints, find Terra Plata and any restaurant within 50 feet is guranteed to set you back $50 per person, but the ambience is par none.  Coffee - You MUST go to Cafe Vivace Espresso Sidewalk. The best baristas rotate through this location and the coffee is so smooth, it is slightly sweet. No need for extra sugar!

       "3174    Belltown is the most densely populated neighborhood in Seattle, Washington, United States, located on the city's downtown waterfront on land that was artificially flattened as part of a regrading project. Formerly a low-rent, semi-industrial arts district, in recent decades it has transformed into a neighborhood of trendy restaurants, boutiques, nightclubs, and residential towers and art galleries. The area is named after William Nathaniel Bell, on whose land claim the neighborhood was built. Belltown is home to the Art Institute of Seattle, Antioch University, Argosy University, the Seattle School of Theology & Psychology and RealNetworks Headquarters. It lies directly west of the Denny Triangle neighborhood, where online retailer Amazon is constructing three office towers to house its downtown headquarters, and where the Cornish College of the Arts is located.

A good portion of the peninsula is taken up by Discovery Park, a true heaven for hikers, and with amazing view of the city. Magnolia's business district, called \"the Village\" by locals, is home to many specialty stores like Bartell (drugstore), USPS office, boutiques, salons, and some of Seattle's top restaurants like Mondello, Chinook's At Salmon Bay, Palisade (great weekend brunch), Mulleady's Irish Pub (half a block away from the townhouse), Tanglewood Supreme, Oliver's Twist (great cocktails), Petit Pierre Bakery, Serendipity Café (with a kids' play area), among others.

The analyses earlier gives us the exact neighbourhood that are most expensive, 'Queen Anne' toping the ist. Furthermore, we also saw that boats have the highest average price when compared to other property types. It is then followed by condominiums, loft, house etc. As expected, booking an entire house/apt is almost double (2X) the average price of private rooms and 3.5X the shared rooms."

    "- From the analyses on the Seattle Airbnb data, we found out that people love to visit this as a toursity spot because of its natural beauty. Averag price of the house varies from 120 - 125 a night depending upon a lot of factors with time of the year being one of the key drivers. \n",
    "- We noticed July - August to be the most busiest months of the year and also most expensive ones based on the average monthly price being as high as 150 a night. November to April seems to be a slow season with November, December being the slowest with a lot of houses being available to  book for the entire month. Good weather in Seattle in the month of July-August along with the July holidays also are potential reason for these monthe being the busiest.\n",
    "- A pattern is seem with hosts dropping the house prices potentially offering discounts, or promotions to attract more bookings in the slow months. This is noticed especially in the month of December, January and somewhat in March, April where following a slow month with no bookings, low prices resulted in a relative increase of the bookings. Post April, the price increases continuously until August / early September after which it starts to decline again.\n",
    "- From our analyses, we also were able to identify the most expensive zipcodes and neighbourhoods, 'Queen Anne' to be on top thst is closely being followed by areas like 'Central Business District', 'Belltown', and 'Magnolia'. Something to notice was the easy transit, better reach to areas of necessasities, and things to do in a area were a few reasons explaining the high prices in these areas.\n",
    "- Few ther things driving and also impacted the house were the trustworthyness and reputation of the hosts, bed ad bath available along with other amenities available and extra fees associated with the host. Type of property and room also played a significant role in defining the house price."
